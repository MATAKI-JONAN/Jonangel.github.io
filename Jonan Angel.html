They smear lies on their faces. please bby wange Angel, don't be a victim of such because it's hurtful and in most cases it makes such girls to loose their respect. 
 Baby, One of the things that make you beautiful, respected with dignity is you being punctual , have only one lover, don't entertain people who convince you with funny reasons to fall in love with you. Such people use you and make you lose value, later dump you as well as bragging about how much they have spoiled you. 
Any beautiful girl who entertains many relationships is never beautiful. She is instead not valuable.Beauty flows with self respect.
‎I request you to stick to one relationship, guard it and do everything that makes you and your husband happy.

‎You are a very beautiful girl that's why I want you to keep the gift that God gave you safe because beauty isn't with everyone. But it can easily be lost if it's not protected.
‎Through what I have seen from many blind girls, I don't want you to be like them darling.
Take my advice as something serious. I say all this because I mind and Care about you. I want us to enjoy our future together. Incase you decide to leave me for another man, still use that advice my darling.
I will continue to pray God to give you as my wife.

‎    <h3> Whenever I get to bed, I say some heart felt word to Angel every night</h3>
‎    <p style=""><b>My Dearest Angel,
As the night gently settles in, I find myself thinking about you, the woman who has loved me beyond measure, even through the silence and distance. My heart aches knowing how long we’ve been apart, and I can only imagine the pain and longing you must feel. Please know, my love, that every beat of my heart whispers your name, and every breath I take carries the promise of coming home to you soon.
‎
You’ve loved me with a kind of depth that words can hardly describe, patient, pure, and endless. For that, I’m forever thankful. You are my peace, my comfort, and the light that brightens every dark night away from you.
‎    
Don’t let your heart worry, my Angel. The wait will soon be over, and when I finally hold you again, I’ll make up for every moment we’ve spent apart. good night my forever love, sleep peacefully and know that you are loved.</b>
‎</p>
  
‎<h3>Whenever I am distanced from my Wife Angel, I fear loosing her and this is this is what I tell her.</h3>
‎<p class="D"><i>There are no words deep enough to explain how much I love you. Every day my heart beats only for you, and even though distance keeps us apart, nothing can separate my love from you. I want you to know that I am fully yours, completely and forever.
‎    
‎I dream of the day I can stand before you, take your hand, and make you my wife. That is all my heart desires. Until then, please keep your love for me safe, just as I keep mine only for you. I cannot love anyone else, Angel, you are my one and only.
‎    
‎Don’t let anyone mislead you or try to take you away from me. My love for you is true, unshakable, and stronger than words could ever capture. Please continue to love me the way you do, because I love you more than life itself.look at her in the figure below.</i>
